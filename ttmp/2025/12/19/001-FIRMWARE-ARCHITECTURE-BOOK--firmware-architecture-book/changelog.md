## 2025-12-19

Created debate framework with 6 participants to explore best approach for writing firmware book. Participants include educators, practitioners, architects, writers, and personified book structures. Defined 8 debate questions covering pedagogy, organization, depth, and practical balance.

## 2025-12-19

Added 6 code entity wildcard participants to debate: SharedData (thread coordinator), UVC Service (perfectionist), Web Server (pragmatist), Camera Driver (mediator), Asset Pool (memory mapper), BMI270 IMU (hardware abstraction). Each brings stats, personality, and specific concerns about how they should be taught in the book.


## 2025-12-19

Completed Debate Round 1 with all 12 participants addressing senior Cortex-M3 engineers. Key tensions: respect vs revelation, speed vs depth, gotchas vs patterns. Agreement on comparison approach, working code early, thread safety critical. Proposed hybrid 12-chapter structure for Round 2 debate.


## 2025-12-19

Completed Debate Round 2. Major refinements: Ch1 gets emotional hook, Ch2 dual-track (quick start + deep dive), Ch3 becomes annotated walkthrough with stress tests, Part 2 reordered for dependency flow (memory before sensors). Converged structure v2 with 12 chapters, ~280 pages. All participants adjusted positions based on cross-examination.


## 2025-12-19

Completed Debate Round 3: Final Synthesis. UNANIMOUS (12/12) approval of Structure v3: 320 pages with exercises in every chapter (Ch2+). Key features: guided+challenge+open-ended exercises, code repo with starter+solution, progressive project (extend M12), hardware exercises (Ch7), measurement-based validation. Includes actionable 24-week plan and sample exercise format. READY TO WRITE.


## 2025-12-19

Completed Debate Round 4: Pre-Mortem Analysis. Participants played devil's advocate, identified 4 risk categories (technical obsolescence, pedagogical, support, scope). APPROVED 11/12 risk-adjusted three-phase plan: Phase 1 Core (Ch1-9, 250 pages, 16 weeks), Phase 2 Advanced (Ch10-12, 8 weeks), Phase 3 Living maintenance. Key mitigations: version pinning, hardware alternatives, flexible reading paths, support boundaries, code licensing.


## 2025-12-19

Created comprehensive writing plan for Phase 1 Core Book (Ch 1-9, 250 pages, 16 weeks). Includes: detailed TOC with page budgets, complete research tasks per chapter, 25 exercise specifications with starter+solution requirements, 35+ diagram list, source file references, dependency graph, writing order. READY TO BEGIN WRITING.


## 2025-12-20

Updated Chapter 1 intern research brief to be codebase-independent, GCC-only, and significantly more specific (what to look for, where to look, suggested queries). Added required deliverable section: GCC workflow delta table.
